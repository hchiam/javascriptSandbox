<p>I needed to include polyfill for this to work: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.9.1/polyfill.min.js</p>
<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.9.1/polyfill.min.js'></script>
<script>
  function* counter() {
    var i = 1
    while (true) yield i++
  }

  let gen = counter()
  
  alert('You should see 1.\n\nThen 2.\n\nThen 3.\n\nAll given to you by the same call to gen.next().value')
  alert(gen.next().value) //1
  alert(gen.next().value) //2
  alert(gen.next().value) //3
  //...
</script>
