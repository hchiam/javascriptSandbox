## Bonus

To automatically re-run a .js file and the test cases in it whenever you edit that file, copy the .js code into `index.js` in my [ESLint repo](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-eslint-google) and do the setup so you can run this command just once: `nodemon -x 'npm run lint; node index.js'`
